# Three Strikes #

Three Strikes is an app for keeping track of the times when people wrong you. 
When a person wrongs you give them a strike! You can record a date and reason 
for the strike, for future review. If a person gets three strikes maybe you
should lose them!  

Three Strikes is a single page application with a Ruby on Rails backend.
The app was created so I could learn Backbone.js.
