# Three Strikes #

Three Strikes is an app for recording violations of your rules. Allocate a strike to those who break youur rules, along with the date of violation and reason for the strike allocation.

Three Strikes is a single page application with a Ruby on Rails backend. The app was created so I could learn Backbone.js.
